django-gpgauth is a django module that provides user authentication through PGP keys.


How it works:
-------------
It registers users by their public PGP key (it accepts only single keys).
It wraps django's authentication system by providing the user with a different password
in each login attempt. This password is encrypted with user's public key and the user
must decrypt the password with his equivalent private key to use it in the login prompt.
Only users whose PGP keys are trusted by the system may login.
